        <h2>The Hunger Problem</h2>
        <p>The issue of hunger is not just about food scarcity; it is rooted in poverty, inequality, and lack of access to resources. Below are some of the key factors contributing to hunger:</p>
        <div class="content-container">
            <img src="images/poverty.jpg" alt="Poverty">
            <div>
                <h3>Poverty</h3>
                <p>Poverty is one of the leading causes of hunger worldwide, affecting millions of people every day.
                     Families living in poverty struggle to afford basic necessities, including nutritious food, 
                     clean water, and proper healthcare. This lack of access to essential resources 
                     creates a vicious cycle where poor health, malnutrition, and reduced productivity further deepen poverty.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="content-container">
            <img src="images/foodwaste.jpg" alt="Food Waste">
            <div>
                <h3>Food Waste</h3>
                <p>Food waste is a critical issue contributing to global hunger, as nearly one-third of all
                     food produced is wasted, while millions of people suffer from food insecurity. 
                     This wastage occurs at multiple stages of the food supply chainâ€”from farms to processing plants,
                      transportation, retail stores, and households. While surplus food is discarded, millions of people 
                      struggle to access nutritious meals,
                     highlighting the need for better food management and distribution systems.</p>

                <p>"Thanks to the Zero Hunger initiative, my community has received not just food but also hope for
                     a better tomorrow. The support has allowed us to focus on rebuilding our lives instead of worrying
                      about where our next meal will come from. Through the meals provided, children are able to
                       attend school regularly and focus on their studies. It has been a life-changing experience for
                        so many families, and we are deeply grateful for the kindness
                     and generosity of those behind this cause." - <strong>John Doe, Volunteer</strong></p>

                <p>"Through donations, we have been able to feed thousands of children,
                     ensuring they don't go to bed hungry. The impact has been far-reaching,
                      not only providing meals but also giving children the energy and strength to focus on their education.
